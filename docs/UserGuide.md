## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide of **Serenity**!

Are you a tutor teaching CS2101 in NUS? Do you struggle to keep track of students' attendance and class participation
on many different excel sheets for different lessons? Do you also tend to forget to address questions students asked
during lessons? Fret not, our application, **Serenity**, will help keep you sane when doing the necessary administrative
work.

**Serenity** is a desktop application that helps CS2101 tutors manage their lessons. This application is optimized
for use through a _Command Line Interface (CLI)_, meaning that you operate the application by typing commands into a
command box. This application also has a _Graphical User Interface (GUI)_, where you can interact with the application
through graphical icons such as buttons.

This user guide serves to provide you with an in-depth documentation on how to set up and use our application.
With that said, let's get [started](#2-quick-start)!
